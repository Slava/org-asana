* Org-Asana
Hopefully a project that will work for my cases.

** Development
*** MVP
**** TODO Sync general structure of the tree and the sub-headings
**** TODO Sync paragraphs and attached info
**** TODO Parse out the `:project:` tag to indicate a traverse start
**** TODO Parse out `TODO` vs `DONE` vs N/A
**** TODO Parse out the `DEADLINE` and `SCHEDULE`

*** More
**** Smart use of Asana sub-headings
**** Write back the Asana IDs to the tasks to minimize recreation of tasks
This can be done by doing two things:

- configuring Emacs to hide the PROPERTIES drawer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17478260/completely-hide-the-properties-drawer-in-org-mode
- writing back to the file the IDs and other metadata
**** Sync over Dropbox
**** Two-way sync, from Asana description fields to Org file
**** Some conflict resolution strategy
